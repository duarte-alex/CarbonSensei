<h4 align="center">"Choose the best GPUs and training time for cost, energy and carbon intensity" - Miyamoto Musashi 2025</h4>

As an ML praticioner you are one click away from reducing the environmental impact of your models and costs. Carbon Sensei
suggests you the best GPUs and training time. As Miyamoto Musashi famously said "You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain". There are two functionalities:

- GPU Dojo - is a transparent and modular tool that fetches GPUs from major cloud providers and allows you to filter them based on how important costs, C02 emissions and energy efficiency are for you.
- Zen Train - our ML models allow you to decide if you should train your model now or in the next hour and offer compreensible analytics on your region energy metrics.
